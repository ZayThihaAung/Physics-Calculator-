# Physics-Calculator-
These programs help students with physics calculation. They are : 
# Ballistic Calculator - This tool is often used by sinpers troops, artillery troops, and weapon engineer to predict how a bullet will travel, how far it drops, and how external factors like wind affect it. Student rarely used it by the way :(
# Energy and Force Calulator - This is designed to calculate potentail enrgy, kinectic energy, NewTon's second law and NewTon's gravitational law. With user-friendly GUI, students would find this too useful and convenient.
# Escape Velocity Calculator - This is for those who are curious about astrophysics. It have 2 versions. First one is programmed to calculate esacpe velocity of planets in solar system by selecting which planet you want to know. Second one simulates whether a rocket escapes the planet or not based on user's input. User only needs to enter the velocity and select the planet which he or she wants to know. In the end the program shows the trajectory of the rocket.
# Planetary Weight Calculator - The program is also for Astrophysics which calculate the weight of 2 objects across the solar system plantes.
