# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few rules to keep things smooth:

- Please open issues for bugs or feature requests before sending PRs.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Follow the repository code style (PEP8). We use flake8 for linting.
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes (pytest).
- Include changelog entry in `CHANGELOG.md` for notable changes.

Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`
3. Run tests and linters locally.
4. Open a pull request with a clear title and description; reference related issues.

Code of conduct
Be respectful. If you are uncertain how to proceed, open an issue and tag the maintainers.
